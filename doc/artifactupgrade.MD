# artifactupgrade
This page is currently a placeholder. The *artifactupgrade* is meant to be implemented in a different topic-branch.

This sub-command is meant to implement something like Flyway for FlureeQL, in a way that works seemlessly with the 
updated output of the [artifact](artifact.MD) subcommand.

The main optional arguments are:

* --host
* --port
* --db
* --beta
* --targetversion
* --nondeploy
* --artifactdir
* --createkey
* --keyfile
* --dockerfind
