## Buld targets and directory structure

This page describes the directory structure used by version 0.1 and version 0.2 of the *fsst* tool. Changes are planned for the 0.3 version in order to allow the use of *fsst* for gracefull schema upgrades on acceptance and production systems..

### Project directory structure.

The directory *demo-schema-parts* contains a sample project directory structure. 

You should create your own project directories.

When invoking *fsst*, a directory should be specified with the *--dir* option. This directory should contain a file named *build.json* with a structure as below:

```json
{
    "default": [
        "roles",
        "there_can_be_only_one"
    ]
}
```

In this file *default* is the one and only build *target*. A build.json should always have a *default* defined, but can define other build targets as well. When invoking *fsst*, normally the *default* build target will be used. This can be overruled by specifying the *--target* option.

Each build target specifies a list of build *steps*. In the example above, we have two *steps*, the step "roles" and the step "there\_can\_be\_only\_one". For each step, either a json file or a *step directory* should exist. The most basic definition of a step is simply a json file with Fluree transactions in a JSON array. No extra processing is done on such files, the transactions are simply added as is.

Things are different for *step directories*. A step directory must contain a JSON file named *main.json*. This file can, just like the JSON file we just mentioned, just a list of as-is FlureeDB transactions, but the operations inside the transactions may also contain one or more of special *pre-processing fields*, that we will get to in the section *operation expansion*. 

Next to the file *main.json*, a *step directory* may contain the file *test.json* for [unit testing](unittest.MD) the stage.

### Operation expansion

This functionality comes in handy mostly when working on data centric security with FlureeDB. FlureeDB comes with a really powerfull access control feature that allows queries and transactions to be guarded by so called smart functions. Smart functions are written in a subset of the Clojure/ClojureScript language. Queries and transactions though are written in FlureeQL JSON. The clojure code needs to be put in JSON strings, and often the FlureeQL JSON needs to be first chopped up and put into Clojure expressions. The *fsst* tool comes with three pre-processing keys for transaction operations that help ease this process.

#### The code\_from\_query key

The use of this key can best be shown:
```json
{
    "name" : "roleCount",
    "code_from_query" : {
      "select": ["(count ?auth)"],
      "where":[
        ["?roles", "_role/id", "PARAM"],
        ["?auth", "_auth/roles", "?roles"]
      ]
    },
    "doc" : "Retrieve count for a specific role",
    "_id" : "_fn$roleCount",
    "params" : ["myRole"]
  }
```
The above will be pre-processed by the *fsst* tool into the operation below:
```json
{
    "name": "roleCount",
    "doc": "Retrieve count for a specific role",
    "_id": "_fn$roleCount",
    "params": ["myRole"],
    "code": "(query (str  \"{\\\"select\\\": [\\\"(count ?auth)\\\"], \\\"where\\\": [[\\\"?roles\\\", \\\"_role/id\\\", \\\"\" myRole \"\\\"], [\\\"?auth\\\", \\\"_auth/roles\\\", \\\"?roles\\\"]]}\" ) )"
}
```
It is important to note that in case of more than one parameter, the source operation should possibly use sorted JSON keys in order to avoid unexpected substitution. 

#### The code\_expand key

While not as problamatic to escape manually as the example above, it can be usefull to keep hand-written clojure in seperate clojure files.

That means we can put the following in main.json:
```json
{
    "name" : "roleAssignedHeadOfState?",
    "code_expand" : "roleAssignedHeadOfState.clj",
    "_id" : "_fn$roleAssignedHeadOfState",
    "doc" : "Is the role HeadOfState Assigned to 0 or 1 Auths?"
}
```
And put the clojure into roleAssignedHeadOfState.clj:
```lisp
(<= (nth (roleCount "headofstate") 0) 1)
```
This will get expanded to
```json
{
    "name" : "roleAssignedHeadOfState?",
    "code" : "(<= (nth (roleCount \"headofstate\") 0) 1)",
    "_id" : "_fn$roleAssignedHeadOfState",
    "doc" : "Is the role HeadOfState Assigned to 0 or 1 Auths?"
}
```
#### The COMMENT key

This one is mostly meant for tests. As JSON doesn't come with any possibility to add comments, we allow the key COMMENT
to be added to operations. The *fsst* tool will strip out all ocurences of COMMENT keys in operations and queries.
